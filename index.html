                  We started as a group of Blender 3D users in and around Salt
                  Lake City, Utah, meeting on

                  for support, networking, and working on projects twice a
                  month. There's plenty of resources (some listed below) for
                  learning this powerful, free, open source 3D creation suite,
                  but we meet online to support each other! Since we started
                  meeting on Discord, we've had people from all over the world
                  join our server, and they too make it an awesome place. Even
                  if you're not an SLC local, we'd love for you to come join us
                  to share your Blender learning adventure!

                  Anyone with an interest in 3D/2D/art that wants to meet with
                  other Blender tinkerers or professionals. We're artists,
                  makers, designers, animators, game devs, programmers, movie
                  makers, educators, and more.
                  <br /><br />
                  We're beginners, to veterans of Blender and other similar
                  software. We welcome users of Maya, 3D max, Lightwave, Cinema
                  4d, Inventor, Sketchup, pen and paper... who are interested in
                  learning Blender.
                  <br /><br />
                  We love to learn and share our love for Art, 3D, design,
                  motion graphics... and how it intersects with Blender. Perhaps
                  you're just interested to see what it's about or you want to
                  expand your toolset and skills, you're welcome too.
                  <br /><br />
